Learning Outcomes
The student will be able to code a simple object oriented application that uses the primitive data types, arithmetic, selection, repetition, and relational operators along with creating and using arrays and ArrayLists.

Assignment Description
Create a class named Rectangle. This class should contain at minimum:
fields for length and width
setters and getters for the fields
a constructor that accepts length and width as parameters
an overloaded 0-arg constructor that sets field values to 0
a method named computeArea that accepts no parameters and returns the area 

Create a class named Circle. This class should contain at minimum:
a field for radius
setters and getters for the field(s)
a constructor that accepts radius as a parameter
an overloaded 0-arg constructor that sets field values to 0
a method named computeArea that accepts no parameters and returns the area

In a separate class, write an application to neatly output, with descriptive text:
the area of two rectangles having sides (4, 5) and (5.7, 8.1) respectively
use each Rectangle constructor once
the area of two circles having radius 4.2 and 3 respectively
use each Circle constructor once
Your output must display your shapes' dimensions and areas. Do not hard-code any values into your output statements.

Example output:

Rectangle with sides 4.0 and 5.0 has area 20.0
Rectangle with sides 5.7 and 8.1 has area 46.17
Circle with radius 4.2 has area 55.41769440932395
Circle with radius 3.0 has area 28.274333882308138

Submission Instructions
Please submit one or more .java files as required.
Please submit screenshot(s) of the program running on your computer. Screenshot(s) should include all output.
